This is the demo code for the Generative Text Convolutional Neural Network (GTCNN), from the paper with the title "Generative Text Convolutional Neural Network for Hierarchial Document Representation Learning".

The source project can be found in https://github.com/BoChenGroup/GTCNN

The details of this model will be coming soon.
