This is the demo code for the Variational Edge Parition Graph Neural Network (VEPM), from the 2022 NeurIPS paper with the title "A Variational Edge Partition Model for Supervised Graph Representation Learning".

The source project can be found in https://github.com/YH-UtMSB/VEPM

The details of this model will be coming soon.
