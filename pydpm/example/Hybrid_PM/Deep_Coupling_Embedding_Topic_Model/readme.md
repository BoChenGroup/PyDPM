This is the demo code for the Deep Coupling Embedding Topic Model (dc-ETM), from the 2022 NeurIPS paper with the title "Alleviating ''Posterior Collapse'' in Deep Topic Models via Policy Gradient".

The source project can be found in https://github.com/BoChenGroup/dc-ETM

The details of this model will be coming soon.
